The treatment of infrared divergences in Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) QCD calculations becomes significantly more complex when accounting for massive quarks, particularly in processes where mass effects cannot be neglected. We present a generalization of the Nested Soft-Collinear (NSC) subtraction scheme to incorporate arbitrary massive quark flavours, preserving the original frameworkâ€™s efficiency while systematically addressing mass-dependent divergences. \\
By removing the need for massless approximations, this work enables precision calculations in particle production processes where quark mass effects are theoretically or phenomenologically relevant.
