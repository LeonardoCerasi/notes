Good morning, I'm Leonardo Cerasi and I going to talk about a generalization of the NSC subtraction scheme to include final-state massive quarks.

[slide 2]
To indoduce, our current best model of fundamental interactions is the Standard Model, which is a gauge theory which includes the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions. In particular, electro-weak interactions affect all fundamental fermions, while only quarks are affected by the strong force, whose theory is Quantum Chromodynamics.

[slide 3]
Although the SM has been extensively tested and confirmed at particle accelerators, there are many signals of Beyond-Standard-Model physics, mainly from astrophysical data, but no direct observation of BSM particles has ever happened. Hence, the research paradigm has shifted from direct searches to precision analyses, especially at particle accelerators.

[slide 4]
Precision studies of hadronic scatterings are made difficult by the fact that hadrons are composite particles. However, a particular class of processes is best suited for precision searches, and these are hard scattering processes, which are characterized by a large momentum transfer. These high energies allow to describe the partons inside each hadron as free particles, thanks to the aymptotic freedom of QCD.

[slide 5]
To formalize this description, we use the factorization theorem of QCD, which gives the relation between hadronic-scale physics and partonic-scale physics, which are clearly energetically separated. It is important to note that only hadronic quantities are physically observables, but from now on we only consider the underlying partonic scattering.

[slide 6]
As the strong running coupling is 0.1 at these energies, thanks to the aforementioned asymptotic freedom, we can expand the partonic cross-section in a perturbative series: then, we have the leading-order cross-section and a series of beyond-leading-order corrections. We distinguish between two kinds of corrections: real and virtual corrections.

[slide 7]
To illustrate their difference, consider for example the Drell-Yan process: real corrections include additional initial- or final-state radiation, while virtual corrections include additional partonic loops.

[slide 8]
The main problem of computing NLO corrections is that they present infrared singularities in particular kinematic regimes. For example, consider the radiation of a gluon from a massless quark: the matrix element is proportional to the propagator shown, which is clearly divergent when the energy of the gluon goes to zero, which is the soft limit, and when the gluon is emitted parallel to the quark, which is the collinear limit.

[slide 9]
We can regularize both kinds of singularities with dimensional regularization. Indeed, we can see how both soft and collinear divergences can be expressed as poles in the dimensional parameter \epsilon.

[slide 10]
Our aim is to extract IR poles to show that they cancel in the total cross-section. To do so we introduce a subtraction scheme: the general idea is to subtract and then add back the singularities, so to obtain a finite result which can be numerically integrated. However this procedure is highly non-trivial, contrary to example shown, as in reality we have to deal with nested multidimensional integrals. In particular, we want to find a set of general counterterms which have an analytic expression and whose pole structure is the same as that of the QCD amplitues that we consider.

[slide 11]
A promising SS is the Nested Soft-Collinear SS, which at NLO is equivalent to the FKS SS. The main feature of this SS is that it represents the singular kinematic limits as operators acting on matrix elements. Then, poles are extracted by rewriting the identity operator as a sum of two counterterms, which respectively contain the soft and collinear singularities, and a finite reminder which is IR-safe.

[slide 12]
Performing the subtraction procedure, we obtain a final expression for the cross-section, which contains a finite reminder, shown in blue, and a series of counterterms: the green one is the finite part of the one-loop corrections, the yellow one is a universal counterterm from the collinear renormalization of PDFs, and the red one is the one we're intereted in, stemming directly from the extraction of IR poles.

[slide 13]
To define this counterterm, first we note that, in the NSC, poles are extracted as operators acting on the LO matrix element. In particular, we see that the soft and virtual operators have a quadratic pole, while the collinear operator only has a simple pole in \epsilon.

[slide 14]
Hence, we first consider the sum of I_S and I_V: performing the Laurent expantion in \epsilon we find that the quadratic poles cancel (the -1 and 1 highlighted in red), and we're left with a simple poles in \epsilon.

[slide 15]
The residue of this simple pole is precisely equal and opposite to the one of the collinear operator, so we show that poles explicitely cancel out, leaving the total operator given by the sum of the soft, collinear and virtual operators IR-safe.

[slide 16]
A limitation of this procedure is that it only considers massless partons, so my work has been that of generalizing this SS to include final-state massive quarks. Indeed, this partons behave differently from massless ones, as the mass regulates collinear divergences. Therefore, the collinear operator remains unchanged, while we have to generalize the soft and virtual operators.

[slide 17]
To generalize the soft operator, I introduced a generalized massive angular integral I_{i,j}, which is \epsilon-finite if i and j are both massive, it has a simple pole if one is massive and the other massless, and has a quadratic pole if they're both massless.

[slide 18]
The virtual operator has been generalized by Catani over two decades ago, and this generalization contains two singular functions. The V_{i,j} function has properties similar to the massive integral I introduced: it has a simple pole if i and j are both massive, and a qudratic pole in any other case. \Gamma_i instead has only simple poles in \epsilon.

[slide 19]
Then, we consider again the sum of I_S and I_V, and rewrite it as three summations: the first is a sum over different partons between all partons that take part to the scattering, the second sum is over a single parton between all final-state massive partons, and the third sum is over a single parton between all massless partons, both initial- and final-state. We now consider each sum separately.
The first sum can be written as a pole term and a finite reminder.

[slide 20]
Upon further analysis, I showed that the quadratic poles in the pole term cancel, leaving only simple poles with residues dependent on massless energetic logarithms.

[slide 21]
The second sum is manifestly \epsilon-finite, and the finite reminder contains massive logarithms.

[slide 22]
And the third sum has isolated simple poles by definition, plus a counterterm with massive logarithms.

[slide 23]
So, putting everything together we obtain a pole strucure equal to that of the massless-only case, so the pole cancellation is carried out again and we're left with a finite reminder. I also computed the analytic expression of the finite counterterms, in particular those denoted by cyrillic letters, and they correctly contain massive logarithms, as we expected from the inclusion of massive partons.

[slide 24]
All in all, I managed to show that the pole cancellation happens even in presence of massive final-state quarks, and I computed the analytic expression of the counterterms. This work paves the way for an application of the NSC SS at NLO to heavy-quark processes, and also to a generalization to NNLO with massive quarks.
